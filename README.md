## 🧠 The Problem

Many developers struggle to stay consistent with coding practice because:

- ❌ Practice is random and unstructured  
- ❌ Choosing the right problem is difficult  
- ❌ There is no accountability or habit system  
- ❌ Progress is hard to track  

As a result, motivation drops and long-term growth slows down.
